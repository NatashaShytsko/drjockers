					<p>Early in my professional career, at the age of 28, I developed skin cancer and began researching everything I needed to do naturally to reverse this condition. This program represents the foundational diet that I used in order to get well and it has improved my brain, body and overall quality of life.</p>
					<p>Today, I am sought out all over the world to customize plans for people who want to use the ketogenic diet to strengthen their body, improve their brain and life performance and/or overcome chronic disease.</p>
					<p>This masterclass is a result of putting all of my keto strategies together into one program so one could access it in a user friendly, visually appealing manner. This can also benefit the thyroid and adrenal glands and help to optimize muscle development and physical performance for high performers and athletes.</p>
					<p>Whether you are looking to lose 15, 30, or 50 lbs, or interested in overcoming a chronic pain or illness, I truly hope you get the most out of this keto masterclass.</p>
