					<p>Most people in this world spend more time jumping from one diet to the next instead of finding and committing to a sound solution that actually works for them.</p>
					<p>Do you know why this is?</p>
					<p>Because most diets are designed with a "one size fits all" mentality.</p>
					<p>But you are not the same person as someone 10 years older than you or 10 years younger than you, and vice versa.</p>
					<p>However, <strong>nearly ALL DIETS are created to fit one generic person.</strong></p>
					<p>They give a brief overview of how the body works... what meals you need to eat... how long you should do it... but then immediately pivot to, "If you want real results, come buy our chalky food or join our membership program!"</p>
					<p>But we're here to tell you <span class="underline">it does NOT have to be this way</span>, <strong>so read every word on this page.</strong></p>
					<p>As you may have already discovered, it’s practically impossible to decipher between the programs that take your money and the ones that actually deliver real results.</p>
					<p>So what's the secret to getting around this roadblock?</p>
					<p><strong>Freedom &amp; guaranteed results.</strong></p>
					<p>Here’s what we’ve discovered:</p>
					<p class="text-center col-lg-11 mx-auto">…When you’re given freedom to try the most cutting edge techniques, healthy tactics, strategies, and more, as well as unspoken secrets with an unconditional guarantee, your chances of success SKYROCKET, which means you'll look years younger and <strong class="red">BURN fat FASTER, and it'll STAY gone!</strong></p>
					<p class="text-center"><em>...and you feel confident doing it (no matter if it's something new)!</em></p>
					<p>That’s exactly why I created this Masterclass and why my family, my entire team, as well as our friends and family all subscribe to this incredible methodology.</p>
					<p>Here’s another bit of truth when it comes to the Ketogenic diet…</p>
					<p>A ketogenic diet is a very low carbohydrate, moderate protein and high fat based nutrition plan. A ketogenic diet trains the individual’s metabolism to run off of fatty acids or ketone bodies. This is called fat adapted or keto adapted, when the body has adapted to run off of fatty acids/ketones at rest.</p>
					<p>This nutrition plan has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation. It also improves cellular healing and mitochondrial biogenesis which supports stronger and healthier cells. All of this leads to reduced risk of chronic disease as well as improved muscle development and fat metabolism.</p>
					<p>Now, you're probably wondering... how does Keto even work?  Well...</p>

						<li><i class="fas fa-check"></i><span>Okay, I have one question for you… <em>how healthy is your fat metabolism?</em> Not sure? That’s quite alright, this is a special concept that most doctors don’t even know about.  In fact, your healthy fat metabolism is critical for your health and the success of a ketogenic diet. And I’m going to dive deep into what this is and how you can maintain a high level of health, 100% of the time.</span></li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-check"></i><span>One massive contributing factor to why people get poor results with the ketogenic diet is malabsorption. If you’re not familiar, this is where your body is not absorbing the proper nutrients to switch on its internal fat burning mechanism. In fact, there are six (6) factors that contribute to why your body stops processing the nutrients it needs to effectively burn fat — <em>and all six can be easily avoided with the proper techniques and strategies (yes, you will learn all six in this lesson).</em></span></li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-check"></i>Finally, I’m going to show you the eight (easy to implement) steps to improving your fat metabolism and how you can kick your fat burning machine into high gear. Be sure to grab your pen and notepad — these steps have only been released to my most trusted patients and customers, you won’t want to miss it…</li>

					<div class="head mb-4"><strong class="dark-blue">Unreleased Lesson 10:</strong> The Eight Best Supplements to Fuel Your Keto Journey</div>
					<p>This lesson is specifically designed for people who are serious about getting real results (and fast) with the ketogenic diet. Supplementation is the #1 way to help your body push through any deficiency barriers and help expedite your results so you can work smarter, not harder on your route to complete success.</p>
					<p>AND… to help you navigate the millions of supplements out there on the market today, I’m going to give you MY top 8 supplements designed to supercharge your keto journey.</p>
					<p>Here's just a glimpse at two of my favorite supplements...</p>
					<p><i class="fas fa-check mt-2 mr-3"></i>Supplement #2: your ultimate ketogenic short cut. You see… typically, the body must digest fats, carry them to the liver, convert them into this one protein, and then transport them to the cells for energy. But guess what, you can bypass that lengthy process and take them direct — giving your body a mainline shot of fuel upon consumption. Talk about powerful!</p>
					<p><i class="fas fa-check mt-2 mr-3"></i>Supplement #7: how would you like to get your hands on a supplement that is dubbed, “the body’s master antioxidant”? If that’s not catching your attention then what if I told you that this one supplement is an absolute powerhouse in the fight against inflammation as well as oxidative stress and damage throughout the body. Sound too good to be true? Well, it’s not. Take as directed!</p>
					<p>In a nutshell, this lesson is the (keto-friendly) icing on top the already powerful (fat burning) cake. If you’re looking to get real results from keto, and not just here to dabble and taste the hors d’ouvres, then I highly recommend you give yourself the best chance for success with this incredible bonus lesson.</p>
